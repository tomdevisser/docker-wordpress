# Sail üê≥ | A Docker Environment for WordPress Development

This repository provides a fully containerized WordPress development environment using Docker Compose. It includes:

- PHP-FPM (custom image)
- nginx
- MySQL
- phpMyAdmin
- WordPress core
- TLS certificates
- Custom domain mapping
- WP-CLI for automation (with theme auto-activation and plugin cleanup)
- Custom `sail` and `dock` scripts for easy bootstrapping and teardown

## Requirements

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed and running on your system  
  (Docker Desktop is optional ‚Äî any Docker-compatible runtime works)
- [`mkcert`](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) installed for generating trusted local TLS certificates
- A WordPress theme folder (your own or cloned from Git)
- [`sshpass`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/sshpass) installed for automated SSH authentication

---

## Getting Started

1. Place your theme files inside the `theme/` directory.
2. If you'd like to rename the `theme` folder, update all references to `theme` in the config files (`docker-compose.yml`, `config/sail.conf`, etc.).
3. Copy `config/sail.sample.conf` to `config/sail.conf` and edit your preferred domain name.
4. Run `./bin/sail` to build and start the environment.
5. Visit https://yourdomain.sail/ to view the site, and https://pma.yourdomain.sail/ to access the database.
6. Run `./bin/dock` to stop the environment.

## Syncing Plugins and Database from Production

You can automatically sync plugins and the database from your live (production) environment to your local development setup.

### Prerequisites
- Fill in your SSH/SFTP credentials in `config/sail.conf` (`remote_user`, `remote_host`, `remote_port`, `remote_path`, `remote_pass`).
- Ensure `sshpass` is installed for non-interactive authentication.

### Sync Plugins and Core Version
- Run `./bin/lib/sync_with_remote.sh`
  - Downloads all plugins from the remote server to your local `plugins/` folder.
  - Updates your local WordPress core version to match the remote (only if different).
  - Requires Docker to be running and the WordPress container to be available as `dev-wordpress`.

### Sync Database
- Run `./bin/lib/sync_database.sh`
  - Exports the database from the remote server, downloads it to your local `database/` folder (with a timestamped filename), and imports it into your local WordPress.
  - Runs a search-replace for the full remote site URL (including protocol) to your local site URL, ensuring all links and assets work correctly.
  - Cleans up the SQL file from the container after import, but keeps a backup locally.
